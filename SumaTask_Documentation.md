## Project Description

### Overview

SumaTask is a comprehensive, modern task management system designed to streamline workflow processes and enhance team productivity. Built using the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, Node.js), the application provides organizations with powerful tools to manage projects, tasks, and team collaboration efficiently.

### Problem Statement

Many organizations struggle with task management, project coordination, and team collaboration. Traditional tools often lack proper role-based access control, intuitive interfaces, or comprehensive project oversight capabilities. SumaTask addresses these challenges by providing a unified platform that combines project management, task tracking, and team collaboration in one seamless application.

### Solution

- **Role-based Access Control**: Three distinct user roles (Admin, Project Manager, Team Member) with specific permissions
- **Intuitive Task Management**: One-click task completion with smart permission checking
- **Comprehensive Project Oversight**: Full project lifecycle management from planning to completion
- **Modern User Interface**: Responsive design built with Tailwind CSS for optimal user experience
- **Real-time Collaboration**: Team directory, user profiles, and project assignment tracking

### Target Audience

- **Small to Medium Businesses**: Organizations looking for efficient project and task management
- **Development Teams**: Software development teams requiring agile project management
- **Educational Institutions**: Schools and universities managing academic projects
- **Freelancers and Consultants**: Individual professionals managing multiple client projects
